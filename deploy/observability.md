# Observability on Candle Cloud

In today's dynamic software landscape, having a clear insight into your application's behavior and performance is crucial. Candle Cloud's observability features provide the tools you need to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your Wick applications.

## Logs

Logs provide a chronological record of events and interactions within your application. They're essential for debugging, monitoring application health, and understanding user behavior.

### Accessing Logs:

1. **From Deployment Summary**:

   - Navigate to the `Deployments` section on the Candle Cloud dashboard.
   - Click on the "logs" link to view the logs related to that specific deployment.

2. **Using Date Range Filter**:
   - In the logs section, select your desired start and end time.
   - Select the deployment you want to view logs for.
   - Click "show logs" to view logs within that timeframe.

Logs are presented in near real-time and are crucial for understanding both routine operations and unexpected behaviors within your applications. currently the maximum limit for logs in a single query is 500 lines.

## Future Enhancements

Candle Cloud is always evolving to provide you with better tools and insights. While logs are the primary observability feature at this stage, our team is hard at work to add more metrics and monitoring capabilities. These upcoming features aim to offer an even more in-depth look into your applications, ensuring you have all the information needed to make informed decisions and improvements.
