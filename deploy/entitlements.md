# Entitlements on Candle Cloud _(beta)_

Entitlements on Candle Cloud denote the specific resources allocated to you based on your account or subscription type. They provide a clear snapshot of what you can utilize when deploying and managing your Wick applications on Candle Cloud. Regularly reviewing your entitlements helps in optimizing your deployment strategy and ensures efficient utilization of resources.

To view your entitlements, click your username in the top right corner and click on `Entitlements`.

During our beta period, the entitlements can change at any time.

## Current Entitlements

Here's a detailed breakdown of the current entitlement options on Candle Cloud:

### Compute Power

Compute power signifies the amount of processing power allocated to you. Depending on the complexity and needs of your Wick applications, you may need to be cognizant of this limit.

### Deployments

This entitlement represents the number of Wick applications or instances you can have running concurrently.

### Requests

Requests denote the number of API or service calls your deployment can handle. It's crucial to monitor this closely, especially for applications with heavy user interactions or integrations.

### Bandwidth

Bandwidth entitlement relates to the amount of data transfer allowed, which can include both inbound and outbound data.

### Users

This signifies the number of users that can be associated with each tenant.

### Memory

Memory allocation is crucial for applications that have heavy data processing, caching, or require in-memory operations.
